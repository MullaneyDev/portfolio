            <h2>Why Code Nation?</h2>
            <p>For the last 10 years I have been working within the education sector as a Teaching assistant and then a Teacher.<br>
            After the birth of my two children, I have made the decision to change my career path so that I can spend more time mentally with my family.<br>
            Coding is something I have always been interested in and as part of my last job I was the computing lead for the school.<br>
            This allowed me to become more involved with the education of young people and their interactions with the digital world.<br>
            I implemented a new coding curriculum as well as investing in new technology to allow the children to become better equiped for the future. </p>
            <p>I have a friend who completed the Code Nation:Master Software course last year and he recommended it to me as a way to pursue my interests. <br>
            His experiences were very positive and made it an easy decision for me about my course provider.</p>
